Unfortunatly, due to an NDA agreement, I cannot elaborate further here, but would love to discuss the things I can in an interview.

- Raizit is an israeli start-up specializing in public participation and consultation. The Raizit proprietary platform enables organizations of various kinds to create, manage, distribute and conclude public participation processes.
- I am working with them on various projects since three years ago, and my latest project is to develop a strategic NLP feature for them.
- I am in charge on the process of developing that feature from research to development and work with the COO to understand the product side and business needs.
